Good Datasets for AI Model Training in the Power and Energy Domain 

**Abstract**

Application and development of advanced AI models provide pivotal solutions for various power and energy system (PES) issues and challenges. The performance of AI models is heavily dependent on the availability of high-quality datasets. However, such datasets are often insufficiently documented. To address this challenge, we are launching the competition “Good Datasets for AI Model Training in the Power and Energy Domain”, which aims to identify, curate, and promote exemplary datasets that can accelerate research and development in PES. The competition is open to the public, inviting students and researchers at all levels to showcase datasets that demonstrate excellence in quality, relevance, accessibility, and impact on AI-driven solutions for power systems, renewable integration, energy efficiency and security, grid resilience, and sustainability.
